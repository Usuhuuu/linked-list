# Linked List Program (C++)

## 📌 Purpose

This program demonstrates basic **linked list** operations in **C++**.  
It allows you to manage a list of integer values.  
The list starts with the following default values:

```
20 → 30 → 50 → 70 → 90
```

## 🎯 Features / Main Points

The linked list supports the following operations:

### 1. 🔼 Insert at Beginning
- Add a new value at the **start** of the list.

### 2. 🔽 Insert at End
- Add a new value at the **end** of the list.

### 3. ➕ Insert at Position
- Add a new value at a **specific position** in the list.
- If the position is 1 or less, it will be added at the start.

### 4. ❌ Delete a Node
- Remove a node by entering its **value**.
- If the value is found, the node is deleted.

### 5. 📋 Display List
- Print the entire list from **head to tail**.
- Shows the order of values.

## 🛠 How It Works

The list is built using a **singly linked list**:
- Each node contains an `int` value.
- Each node points to the **next** node.
- The `head` pointer represents the **start** of the list.

## 🧪 Initial State

When you run the program, it automatically creates the following list:
